A Simple User Management Application 

This project is a Spring MVC application in which users in the database are listed and new users are added, updated and deleted. It retrieves user information in a modal dialog with a captcha and inserts the record after validation. All the operations are done in one page.

This project also includes a REST API written with Java. The web page in the project consumes this api with AJAX requests.
